## About me

My introduction to web development occurred a year ago. Since then, my goal has remained unchanged - to become one of the best professionals in this field. I am curious, persistent, and attentive to detail, which is why I always strive for my final work to be perfect. In addition to that, I actively study new technologies and the latest trends in web development. I participate in online courses, read specialized literature, and apply the acquired knowledge in practice.
